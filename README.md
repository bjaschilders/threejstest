<H1>Three.JS Test</H1>
<p>While I was trying to find new ways of making data display seem more interesting I started experimenting with three.js, whilst a lot of the things I made had information of the company I was working for, this was a freerange project I made on my own, a little space where cubes and spheres would bounce around, all made with Javascript.</p><br>
<p>Use W to add more cubes.</p>
<p>Use S to remove cubes.</p>
<p>Use Up Arrow to add more spheres.</p>
<p>Use Down Arrow to remove spheres.</p>
